# DLDR - Daily Learning Deep Reads

We all think we need to learn something that can be <b>useful</b> at some point in our career. But what I realized lately is the term useful is very subjective and unpredictable as we don't know the future. So, it is always very important to stay <b><i>curious</i></b> to progress professionally and in other aspects as well. Curiosity and learning things out of comfort zone helps us to stay sharp and connect the dots in the grand scale. 

As part of that, I plan to document whatever I learn in this repository. `Daily learning` signifies that the learning efforts should be consistent and `deep reads` signifies that we need to understand the concepts in-depth.

Whether it be reading a new blog post, a Youtube tutorial or a lecture video; if I feel I've learned something meaningful, I will add it here. I can also add a list of to-read's that can enhance my learning.

I believe most of the content that comes to this repo will be technical but not exactly related to my job.

So, to sum it up - Be curious, don't stop learning and document.

Learning how to code in Pytorch

I try to code NN, ML, DL stuff from various sources as part of my learning. This replication helps me to revise easily in future and also it's a great practice to learn DL.
